            <p>Erin Peters grew up in Northeast Missouri with her loving family and friends. Erin went to a local school and attended dance classes at her aunt’s studio (with which she would soon teach classes). Erin would soon go on to graduate high school in the top 10 of her class (a class of only 60 students as it was an extremely small school) and would gain many academic awards and awards from the clubs that she participated in (such as FBLA, Student Council, Spanish Club, and Art Club).</p>
            <p>After high school, Erin decided to continue her education at John Wood Community College and continue her dance career. Here she received her Associates degree and decided to leave the little town and move onto bigger things. She then moved to Springfield to start her Master’s in Business Administration and Missouri State University. With this big move, she decided to end her dance career and get a job at a children's consignment shop. She also decided to bring her cat, Tiny, with her as her companion. These two have gone on many adventures and plan to go on many more.</p>
            <p>After Erin finishes her degree, she is planning on going into Real Estate and starting her own Real Estate business. She is still unsure where she might want to do this, but she loves the idea of having her own schedule and being able to travel and drive everywhere (and not being confined to an office).</p>
            <p>While she has plans for her professional career, she is also planning on travelling the world and going on all sorts of adventures. Erin is hoping to travel to places such as Greece and Alaska, and hopefully one of these days, jumping out of an airplane (with a parachute, of course). She is also planning on starting a family, but that is something that goes a little further than the five-year plan.</p>
            <p>Erin has many aspirations and goals in life and will put in the work to achieve those goals. For now, she is focused on finishing her Spring term in college and having a wonderful summer in the beautiful state of Missouri with her friends and family.</p>
