            <p>Erin stated that she is an “avid TikTok” watcher. For those that are not sure about TikTok it is an app that shows videos that other content creators have put out there for viewers to watch. It came about in 2018, but it really did not gain speed until 2019 and really picked up after COVID-19 hit the world. TikTok is another form of entertainment for those that have the application. I can vouch that Erin is someone that watches many TikTok videos in her spare time as I usually receive a few.</p>

            <p>I also asked about Erin’s dance experience, and she went on to talk about her time dancing at her aunt’s studio. Erin has been dancing since she could walk, she has always been interested in it and it provided her with a creative outlet. Erin joined her aunt’s studio and soon began to dance competitively. She stated that she always enjoyed this, and she thinks that dancing instilled a strong work ethic and a sense of responsibility. At the age of 16, Erin began teaching some of the dance classes for the younger girls, as she had demonstrated this sense of responsibility and showed a skill for dance. After High School, Erin continued her dance career and continued to dance through her college career at John Wood Community College and continued to teach classes at the studio. It wasn’t until Erin graduated John Wood and decided to continue her education at Missouri State University that she put in her resignation at the dance studio and stopped her dance career. She has many awards and stories to tell about her time at the studio and how grateful she is for her time there.</p>

            <p>Erin also talked about how another one of her hobbies is driving around and listening to music. Some might find this odd, but many people have found this therapeutic as it allows them time to think and catch a breath. I asked Erin what her favorite roads were to drive, and she talked about how she likes to find the roads that are usually curvy and have a bunch of hills, as this is where you will sometimes find the best views of the countryside. I also asked what kind of music she would listen to on these drives, and she went into detail about how it was a mix. Sometimes she will listen to Lizzo and Cardi B, and other times it is Morgan Wallen and Koe Wetzel. She is very open to many different ranges of music, and if it's got a good tune to it or speaks to her, she will usually have it at full blast.
